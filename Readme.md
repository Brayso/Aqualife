These work took me about a week to be fully done. In the cause of these project projext i hade some challenges and solutions which will be explained in the following lines.
First i hade to write the html part of the of the code and writing these was pretty chalenging. The problem i faced was that of creating, naming, and placing of the adequate classes where and when to be placed in other for the CSS part of the code to run smothly without any problem, but is never as we always wish. I hade some little help in the selection and attirbutions of the classes, and equally some id's were equally used.
After the completion of the html part, i had to start know with the CSS part of the code. These was the most challenging part as it was go creat grids, add some style to the grid, create different styles for different part of one section. Some of the ideas to solve these problems weere been done after some documentation on the web site W3schools and some tutorial classes on the site scrimba.
Up on all these and some modifications been brought up i was able to come out with the final design which you will be able to see.
